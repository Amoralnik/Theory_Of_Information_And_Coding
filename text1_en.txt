1 Aeneas was a motor boy
And the boy is at least a Cossack,
He managed to do everything evil, nimble,
The most zealous burlak of all.
But the Greeks, after burning Troy,
They turned it into dirty manure,
He, taking the bag, gave a draft;
Taking some Trojans,
Chains greased like weights,
Heels from Troy pointed.
2 He, having quickly made boats,
Descended on the blue sea,
Having planted the Trojans full,
And where did he roll his eyes.
But evil Juno, daughter of a bitch,
Scattered like a hen,
Aeneas did not love - fear;
For a long time she wanted
Let his soul fly away
To hell with the spirit.
3 Aeneas was very unhappy
Juno - everything made her angry;
He seemed more bitter to her than pepper,
Juno did not ask for anything;
But worse than that, she didn't like him,
What, you see, was born in Troy
And he called Venus his mother;
And that his late uncle,
Paris, Priam's child,
He gave Venus a ticket.
4 Saw Juno from heaven,
That Mr. Aeneas is on the ferries;
And the bitch Heba whispered...
Juno was terrified!
She harnessed a peacock to green yellows,
I hid a washing machine under the sink,
So that the scythe does not shine;
Took a skirt and laces,
And bread and salt on a plate,
She rushed to Aeolus like a wasp.
5 "Hello, Aeolus, lord matchmaker!
Oh, how are you, how are you living——
She said as she entered the house,
Juno - Are you expecting guests-.."
She put a plate with bread
Before old grandfather Aeolus,
She herself sat on a donkey.
"Please, old suitor!
Get Aeneas out of confusion,
Now he is sailing on the sea.
6 You know he is such a fighter,
Fuel and throttle;
How else to run around the world,
Someone will shed a lot of tears.
Send him an angry evil,
So that all the people who are with Aeneas,
Slipped and that he himself...
For this black-eyed girl,
Tasty, beautiful, ugly
I will give you what I will give."
7 "Hey, hey! oh, give him the executioner!
Aeolus said with a frown. —
I would do anything for this fee
But all the winds were released:
Boreus is sick with a hangover,
And Not went to the wedding,
Marshmallow, the ancient scoundrel,
Married girls
And Evr got hired as a day laborer, -
If you want, think so!
8 I already promise for you
I will slap Aeneas;
I will try quickly, in a moment
They will drive him to hell in a cane.
Goodbye! hurry up
